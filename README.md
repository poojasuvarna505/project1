## Introduction

Dustin and Lucus are best friends. They spend their weekends watching superhero series and playing superhero games. One Friday at school Mr.Hooper, their computer science faculty taught them HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Dustin & Lucus realised they could build super cool super hero stuff using their knowledge. 

The subsequent weekend, they decided to do it. Lucus and Dustin are now all set to build something super cool.

Lucus always loves protagonists like most of us. But Dustin is quite crazy, he likes antagonists. So they decided to collect a bunch of their favorite Super Heroes and Super Villains names along with their pictures. Did they tell you about the game that they are gonna build? 

Okay, let us explain. They are going to facilitate the ultimate war between Super Heroes and Super Villains. As they are new to these technologies, they need a **ProGrad** to help them build this game.
